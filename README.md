# Predicting home prices in King County

# Scenario: 
## I am a real estate developer, in Seattle, looking to see what home feutures, if added, are likely to increase a homes value.

# Process & Tools Used:
## kc_house_data.csv (file provided)

# Initial findings 
## I started with three question:
### Q1: How significant is location on price?
### Q2: Is outdoor space i.e. squarefootage in the 'lot' that is not accupied by the house, usefull?
### Q3: Does the neighborhood a house is in matter?
